\item{version}{Major version of D3}

extension is "jetpack" (\url{https://github.com/gka/d3-jetpack}).}

\item{minified}{Use minified JavaScript files when available?}

\description{
Create HTML dependencies for D3 and optional extensions
}
\details{
Create list of HTML dependencies for D3. Each version has
a distinct root D3 object so it's possible to combine multiple versions
of D3 on a single page. For example, D3 v5 is accessed via \code{d3v5} and
D3 v4 is accessed via \code{d3v4}. Note however that D3 v3 is accessed via
simply \code{d3} (for compabibilty with existing htmlwidgets that use
this form).
}
\note{
This function is exported for use by htmlwidgets. If you are
using the \code{r2d3()} function to include D3 code within a document
or application this dependency is included automatically so calling
this function is unnecessary.
