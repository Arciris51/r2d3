## Overview

You can redistribute your D3 visualizations as reusable components if you bundle them within an R package. There are two ways to accomplish this:

1) Create a wrapper function for the requisite call to `r2d3()` and include that in a package; or

2) Use your D3 script as the basis for the creation of an [htmlwidget](http://www.htmlwidgets.org).

This article covers both of these techniques, and also describes how to use the `html_dependency_d3()` function to include multiple distinct versions of D3 within a document or application.
